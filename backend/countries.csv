The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in increased democracy ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 communist countercoup. The Soviet Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan communist regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported anti-communist mujahidin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the country’s civil war and anarchy.

Bordée par l'Espagne et la France (donc enclavée dans l'Union européenne), et située dans le massif des Pyrénées, elle est principalement constituée de montagnes élevées. Il s'agit d'un des plus petits États souverains d'Europe, avec une superficie de 468 km2 et une population estimée à 77 000 habitants en 2019. Établie à 1 023 mètres au-dessus du niveau de la mer, Andorre-la-Vieille, sa capitale, est la plus haute d'Europe. La langue officielle est le catalan, la monnaie officielle est l'euro. La devise de l'Andorre est « Virtus Unita Fortior », et son drapeau est constitué de trois bandes verticales bleue, jaune et rouge, la bande jaune étant plaquée de l'écusson andorran. L'hymne national est El Gran Carlemany.
La principauté, dont la création remonte à 780 sous le règne de Charlemagne, est régie par un système unique, le paréage de 1278 et 1288. Ce contrat de droit féodal concède le trône andorran à deux coprinces, l'évêque catalan d'Urgell et le comte de Foix (dont les droits et devoirs sont passés successivement au roi de Basse-Navarre, au roi de France à partir de Henri IV, et enfin au chef d'État français). L'Andorre est sortie de son isolement au XXe siècle, durant lequel elle a profité de son cadre naturel et a utilisé un système fiscal avantageux pour devenir une grande destination touristique, accueillant près de trois millions de visiteurs chaque année. Si la principauté est réputée aujourd'hui pour ses pistes de ski et ses faibles taxes, elle est aussi souvent considérée comme un paradis fiscal. Elle est membre des Nations unies depuis 1993, du Conseil de l'Europe, mais pas de l'Union européenne.",,https://github.com/djaiss/mapsicon/blob/master/all/ad/256.png,"[{'language_uid': 'fre', 'language_name_fr': 'Français', 'popularity': '70.00%', 'popularity_as_float': 0.7, 'speakers': '77,543', 'is_official': 'FALSE', 'language_name_native': 'Français', 'language_wals_code': 'fre', 'language_name_en': 'French'}, {'language_uid': 'spa', 'language_name_fr': 'Espagnol', 'popularity': '60.00%', 'popularity_as_float': 0.6, 'speakers': '50,000.00', 'is_official': 'TRUE', 'language_name_native': 'Español', 'language_wals_code': 'spa', 'language_name_en': 'Spanish'}]","[{'section': 'INTRODUCTION', 'content': {'Background': 'The landlocked Principality of Andorra is one of the smallest states in Europe, nestled high in the Pyrenees between the French and Spanish borders.

Dutch navigators led by Abel TASMAN were the first Europeans to land in Australia in 1606, and they mapped the western and northern coasts. They named the continent New Holland but made no attempts to permanently settle it. In 1770, English captain James COOK sailed to the east coast of Australia, named it New South Wales, and claimed it for Great Britain. In 1788 and 1825, Great Britain established New South Wales and then Tasmania as penal colonies respectively. Great Britain and Ireland sent more than 150,000 convicts to Australia before ending the practice in 1868. As Europeans began settling areas away from the coasts, they came into more direct contact with Aboriginal Australians. Europeans also cleared land for agriculture, impacting Aboriginal Australians’ ways of life. These issues, along with disease and a policy in the 1900s that forcefully removed Aboriginal children from their parents, reduced the Aboriginal Australian population from more than 700,000 pre-European contact to a low of 74,000 in 1933.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Oceania, continent between the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean', 'Geographic_coordinates': '27 00 S, 133 00 E', 'Map_references': 'Oceania', 'Area': {'total': '7,741,220 sq km', 'land': '7,682,300 sq km', 'water': '58,920 sq km', 'note': 'includes Lord Howe Island and Macquarie Island', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '7'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly smaller than the US contiguous 48 states', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '0 km'}, 'Coastline': '25,760 km', 'Maritime_claims': {'territorial_sea': '12 nm', 'contiguous_zone': '24 nm', 'exclusive_economic_zone': '200 nm', 'continental_shelf': '200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin'}, 'Climate': 'generally arid to semiarid;

A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation, recognized Austria’s independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country’s “perpetual neutrality” as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal.

Azerbaijan remains involved in the protracted Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with Armenia. Nagorno-Karabakh was a primarily ethnic Armenian region that Moscow recognized in 1923 as an autonomous oblast within Soviet Azerbaijan. In the late Soviet period, a separatist movement developed which sought to end Azerbaijani control over the region. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1988 and escalated after Armenia and Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By the time a ceasefire took effect in May 1994, separatists, with Armenian support, controlled Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding Azerbaijani territories. Following a Second Nagorno-Karabakh War that took place in September-November 2020, Azerbaijan recaptured much of the territory it had lost a quarter century earlier and under the terms of a cease fire agreement, Armenia returned the remaining territories it occupied to Azerbaijan.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran and Russia, with a small European portion north of the Caucasus range', 'Geographic_coordinates': '40 30 N, 47 30 E', 'Map_references': 'Asia', 'Area': {'total': '86,600 sq km', 'land': '82,629 sq km', 'water': '3,971 sq km', 'note': 'includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the Nagorno-Karabakh region;

In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in 1971. A steady decline in oil production and reserves since 1970 prompted Bahrain to take steps to diversify its economy, in the process developing petroleum processing and refining, aluminum production, and hospitality and retail sectors.

Muslim conversions and settlement in the region began in the 10th century, primarily from Arab and Persian traders and preachers. Europeans established trading posts in the area in the 16th century. Eventually the area known as Bengal, primarily Hindu in the western section and mostly Muslim in the eastern half, became part of British India. Partition in 1947 resulted in an eastern wing of Pakistan in the Muslim-majority area, which became East Pakistan. Calls for greater autonomy and animosity between the eastern and western wings of Pakistan led to a Bengali independence movement. That movement, led by the Awami League (AL) and supported by India, won the independence war for Bangladesh in 1971.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Southern Asia, bordering the Bay of Bengal, between Burma and India', 'Geographic_coordinates': '24 00 N, 90 00 E', 'Map_references': 'Asia', 'Area': {'total': '148,460 sq km', 'land': '130,170 sq km', 'water': '18,290 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '94'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly larger than Pennsylvania and New Jersey combined;

Three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs, and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. Bhutan negotiated a similar arrangement with independent India in 1949. The Indo-Bhutanese Treaty of Friendship returned to Bhutan a small piece of the territory annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and defined India’s responsibilities in defense and foreign relations.

The Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia and Montenegro - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a “Greater Serbia.” In March 1994, Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement creating a joint Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties initialed a peace agreement that ended three years of interethnic civil strife (the final agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995).'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and Croatia', 'Geographic_coordinates': '44 00 N, 18 00 E', 'Map_references': 'Europe', 'Area': {'total': '51,197 sq km', 'land': '51,187 sq km', 'water': '10 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '128'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly smaller than West Virginia', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '1,543 km', 'border_countries_3': 'Croatia 956 km, Montenegro 242 km, Serbia 345 km'}, 'Coastline': '20 km', 'Maritime_claims': 'NA', 'Climate': 'hot summers and cold winters;

More than five decades of uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and significant capital investment have created one of the most stable economies in Africa. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party has won every national election since independence; President Mokgweetsi Eric MASISI assumed the presidency in April 2018 following the retirement of former President Ian KHAMA due to constitutional term limits. MASISI won his first election as president in October 2019, and he is Botswana’s fifth president since independence.

Having successfully weathered a period of global financial difficulty in the late 20th century, Brazil was seen as one of the world’s strongest emerging markets and a contributor to global growth. The awarding of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympic Games, the first ever to be held in South America, was seen as symbolic of the country’s rise. However, from about 2013 to 2016, Brazil was plagued by a sagging economy, high unemployment, and high inflation, only emerging from recession in 2017. Former President Dilma ROUSSEFF (2011-2016) was removed from office in 2016 by Congress for having committed impeachable acts against Brazil’s budgetary laws, and her vice president, Michel TEMER, served the remainder of her second term. In October 2018, Jair BOLSONARO won the presidency with 55% of the vote and assumed office on 1 January 2019.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Eastern South America, bordering the Atlantic Ocean', 'Geographic_coordinates': '10 00 S, 55 00 W', 'Map_references': 'South America', 'Area': {'total': '8,515,770 sq km', 'land': '8,358,140 sq km', 'water': '157,630 sq km', 'note': 'includes Arquipelago de Fernando de Noronha, Atol das Rocas, Ilha da Trindade, Ilhas Martin Vaz, and Penedos de Sao Pedro e Sao Paulo', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '6'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly smaller than the US', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '16,145 km', 'border_countries_10': 'Argentina 1263 km, Bolivia 3403 km, Colombia 1790 km, French Guiana 649 km, Guyana 1308 km, Paraguay 1371 km, Peru 2659 km, Suriname 515 km, Uruguay 1050 km, Venezuela 2137 km'}, 'Coastline': '7,491 km', 'Maritime_claims': {'territorial_sea': '12 nm', 'contiguous_zone': '24 nm', 'exclusive_economic_zone': '200 nm', 'continental_shelf': '200 nm or to edge of the continental margin'}, 'Climate': 'mostly tropical, but temperate in south', 'Terrain': 'mostly flat to rolling lowlands in north; some plains, hills, mountains, and narrow coastal belt', 'Elevation': {'highest_point': 'Pico da Neblina 2,994 m', 'lowest_point': 'Atlantic Ocean 0 m', 'mean_elevation': '320 m'}, 'Natural_resources': 'alumina, bauxite, beryllium, gold, iron ore, manganese, nickel, niobium, phosphates, platinum, tantalum, tin, rare earth elements, uranium, petroleum, hydropower, timber', 'Land_use': {'agricultural_land': '32.9% (2018 est.)', 'arable_land': '8.6% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_crops': '0.8% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_pasture': '23.5% (2018 est.)', 'forest': '61.9% (2018 est.)', 'other': '5.2% (2018 est.)'}, 'Irrigated_land': '54,000 sq km (2012)', 'Major_aquifers': 'Amazon Basin, Guarani Aquifer System, Maranhao Basin', 'Salt_water_lakes': 'Lagoa Mirim (shared with Uruguay) - 2,970 sq km', 'Major_rivers_by_length_in_km': 'Amazon river mouth (shared with Peru [s]) - 6,400 km; Rio de la Plata/Parana river source (shared with Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay [m]) - 4,880 km; Tocantins - 3,650 km; Sao Francisco - 3,180 km; Paraguay river source (shared with Argentina and Paraguay [m]) - 2,549 km; Rio Negro river mouth (shared with Colombia [s] and Venezuela) - 2,250 km; Uruguay river source (shared with Argentina and Uruguay [m]) - 1,610 km', 'Population_distribution': 'the vast majority of people live along, or relatively near, the Atlantic coast in the east; the population core is in the southeast, anchored by the cities of Sao Paolo, Brasilia, and Rio de Janeiro', 'Natural_hazards': 'recurring droughts in northeast; floods and occasional frost in south'}}, {'section': 'PEOPLE AND SOCIETY', 'content': {'Population': '213,445,417 (July 2021 est.)', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '31', 'Nationality': {'noun': 'Brazilian(s)', 'adjective': 'Brazilian'}, 'Ethnic_groups': 'White 47.7%, Mulatto (mixed White and Black) 43.1%, Black 7.6%, Asian 1.1%, Indigenous 0.4% (2010 est.)', 'Languages': 'Portuguese (official and most widely spoken language); note - less common languages include Spanish (border areas and schools), German, Italian, Japanese, English, and a large number of minor Amerindian languages', 'major-language_samples': '', 'Religions': 'Roman Catholic 64.6%, other Catholic 0.4%, Protestant 22.2% (includes Adventist 6.5%, Assembly of God 2.0%, Christian Congregation of Brazil 1.2%, Universal Kingdom of God 1.0%, other Protestant 11.5%), other Christian 0.7%, Spiritist 2.2%, other 1.4%, none 8%, unspecified 0.4% (2010 est.)', 'Demographic_profile': 'Brazil’s rapid fertility decline since the 1960s is the main factor behind the country’s slowing population growth rate, aging population, and fast-paced demographic transition.

In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People’s Republic in 1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its first multiparty election since World War II and began the contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption, and crime.

Burundi’s two major ethnic groups, the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi, share a common language and culture and largely lived in peaceful cohabitation under Tutsi monarchs in pre-colonial Burundi. Regional, class, and clan distinctions contributed to social status in the Burundi Kingdom, yielding a complex class structure. German colonial rule in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and Belgian rule after World War I preserved Burundi’s monarchy. Seeking to simplify administration, Belgian colonial officials reduced the number of chiefdoms and eliminated most Hutu chiefs from positions of power. In 1961, the Burundian Tutsi king’s oldest son, Louis Rwagasore was murdered by a competing political faction shortly before he was set to become prime minister, triggering increased political competition that contributed to later instability.

The British and Spanish disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1862. Territorial disputes between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1992 and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border dispute. Both nations have voted to send the dispute for final resolution to the International Court of Justice. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy.

The fusing of European and various African cultural traditions is reflected in Cabo Verde’s Krioulo language, music, and pano textiles. Following independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cabo Verde continues to sustain one of Africa’s most stable democratic governments and one of its most stable economies, maintaining a currency formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo and then the euro since 1998. Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result, Cabo Verde’s expatriate population - concentrated in Boston and Western Europe - is greater than its domestic one. Most Cabo Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents. Cabo Verde’s population descends from its first permanent inhabitants in the late 15th-century – a preponderance of West African slaves, a small share of Portuguese colonists, and even fewer Italians, Spaniards, and Portuguese Jews. Among the nine inhabited islands, population distribution is variable. Islands in the east are very dry and are home to the country’s growing tourism industry. The more western islands receive more precipitation and support larger populations, but agriculture and livestock grazing have damaged their soil fertility and vegetation. For centuries, the country’s overall population size has fluctuated significantly, as recurring periods of famine and epidemics have caused high death tolls and emigration.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Western Africa, group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Senegal', 'Geographic_coordinates': '16 00 N, 24 00 W', 'Map_references': 'Africa', 'Area': {'total': '4,033 sq km', 'land': '4,033 sq km', 'water': '0 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '175'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly larger than Rhode Island', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '0 km'}, 'Coastline': '965 km', 'Maritime_claims': {'territorial_sea': '12 nm', 'contiguous_zone': '24 nm', 'exclusive_economic_zone': '200 nm'}, 'Climate': 'temperate; warm, dry summer; precipitation meager and erratic', 'Terrain': 'steep, rugged, rocky, volcanic', 'Elevation': {'highest_point': 'Mt.

Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire, ushering in a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French protection in 1863, and it became part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953. In April 1975, after a seven-year struggle, communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off 20 years of civil war.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Southeastern Asia, bordering the Gulf of Thailand, between Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos', 'Geographic_coordinates': '13 00 N, 105 00 E', 'Map_references': 'Southeast Asia', 'Area': {'total': '181,035 sq km', 'land': '176,515 sq km', 'water': '4,520 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '90'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'one and a half times the size of Pennsylvania;

After World War I, the territory was divided between France and the UK as League of Nations mandates. French Cameroon became independent in 1960 as the Republic of Cameroon. The following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge with the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. In 1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary state, the United Republic of Cameroon. The country has generally enjoyed stability, which has enabled the development of agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Despite slow movement toward democratic reform, political power remains firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Central Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria', 'Geographic_coordinates': '6 00 N, 12 00 E', 'Map_references': 'Africa', 'Area': {'total': '475,440 sq km', 'land': '472,710 sq km', 'water': '2,730 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '56'}, 'Area_–_comparative': 'slightly larger than California; about four times the size of Pennsylvania', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '5,018 km', 'border_countries_6': 'Central African Republic 901 km, Chad 1116 km, Republic of the Congo 494 km, Equatorial Guinea 183 km, Gabon 349 km, Nigeria 1975 km'}, 'Coastline': '402 km', 'Maritime_claims': {'territorial_sea': '12 nm', 'contiguous_zone': '24 nm'}, 'Climate': 'varies with terrain, from tropical along coast to semiarid and hot in north', 'Terrain': 'diverse, with coastal plain in southwest, dissected plateau in center, mountains in west, plains in north', 'Elevation': {'highest_point': 'Fako on Mont Cameroun 4,045 m', 'lowest_point': 'Atlantic Ocean 0 m', 'mean_elevation': '667 m'}, 'Natural_resources': 'petroleum, bauxite, iron ore, timber, hydropower', 'Land_use': {'agricultural_land': '20.6% (2018 est.)', 'arable_land': '13.1% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_crops': '3.3% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_pasture': '4.2% (2018 est.)', 'forest': '41.7% (2018 est.)', 'other': '37.7% (2018 est.)'}, 'Irrigated_land': '290 sq km (2012)', 'Major_watersheds_area_sq_km': 'Atlantic Ocean drainage', 'Major_aquifers': 'Lake Chad Basin', 'Major_lakes_area_sq_km': 'Fresh water lake(s)', 'Population_distribution': 'population concentrated in the west and north, with the interior of the country sparsely populated as shown in this population distribution map', 'Natural_hazards': 'volcanic activity with periodic releases of poisonous gases from Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun volcanoes', 'volcanism': 'Mt.

Among the last areas of sub-Saharan Africa to be drawn into the world economy, its introduction into trade networks around the early 1700s fostered significant competition among its population. The local population sought to benefit from the lucrative Atlantic, trans-Saharan, and Indian Ocean trade in enslaved people and ivory. Slave raids aided by representatives from the local populations fostered animosity between ethnic groups that remains today. The territory was established as a French colony named Ubangui-Shari in 1903, and France modeled its administration of the colony after the Belgian Congo, subcontracting control of the territory to private companies that collected rubber and ivory. Although France banned the domestic slave trade in CAR in the 1910s, the private companies continued to exploit the population through forced labor. The colony of Ubangi-Shari gained independence from France as the Central African Republic in August 1960, but the death of independence leader Barthelemy BOGANDA six months prior led to an immediate struggle for power.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Central Africa, north of Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'Geographic_coordinates': '7 00 N, 21 00 E', 'Map_references': 'Africa', 'Area': {'total': '622,984 sq km', 'land': '622,984 sq km', 'water': '0 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '47'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly smaller than Texas; about four times the size of Georgia', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '5,920 km', 'border_countries_6': 'Cameroon 901 km, Chad 1556 km, Democratic Republic of the Congo 1747 km, Republic of the Congo 487 km, South Sudan 1055 km, Sudan 174 km'}, 'Coastline': '0 km (landlocked)', 'Maritime_claims': 'none (landlocked)', 'Climate': 'tropical; hot, dry winters; mild to hot, wet summers', 'Terrain': 'vast, flat to rolling plateau; scattered hills in northeast and southwest', 'Elevation': {'highest_point': 'Mont Ngaoui 1,410 m', 'lowest_point': 'Oubangui River 335 m', 'mean_elevation': '635 m'}, 'Natural_resources': 'diamonds, uranium, timber, gold, oil, hydropower', 'Land_use': {'agricultural_land': '8.1% (2018 est.)', 'arable_land': '2.9% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_crops': '0.1% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_pasture': '5.1% (2018 est.)', 'forest': '36.2% (2018 est.)', 'other': '55.7% (2018 est.)'}, 'Irrigated_land': '10 sq km (2012)', 'Major_watersheds_area_sq_km': 'Atlantic Ocean drainage', 'Mediterranean_Sea': 'Atlantic Ocean drainage', 'Major_aquifers': 'Congo Basin, Lake Chad Basin', 'Major_rivers_by_length_in_km': 'Ubangi river source (shared with Democratic Republic of Congo and Republic of Congo [m]) - 2,270 km', 'Population_distribution': 'majority of residents live in the western and central areas of the country, especially in and around the capital of Bangui as shown in this population distribution map', 'Natural_hazards': 'hot, dry, dusty harmattan winds affect northern areas; floods are common', 'Geography_-_note': 'landlocked; almost the precise center of Africa'}}, {'section': 'PEOPLE AND SOCIETY', 'content': {'Population': '5,357,984 (July 2021 est.)', 'note': 'animistic beliefs and practices strongly influence the Christian majority', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '182', 'Nationality': {'noun': 'Central African(s)', 'adjective': 'Central African'}, 'Ethnic_groups': 'Baya 28.8%, Banda 22.9%, Mandjia 9.9%, Sara 7.9%, M’Baka-Bantu 7.9%, Arab-Fulani (Peul) 6%, Mbum 6%, Ngbanki 5.5%, Zande-Nzakara 3%, other Central African Republic ethnic groups 2%, non-Central African Republic ethnic groups .1% (2003 est.)', 'Languages': 'French (official), Sangho (lingua franca and national language), tribal languages', 'Religions': 'Christian 89%, Muslim 9%, folk religion 1%, unaffiliated 1% (2020 est.)', 'Demographic_profile': 'The Central African Republic’s (CAR) humanitarian crisis has worsened since a coup in March 2013.

These states focused on controlling trans-Saharan trade routes and profited mostly from the slave trade. The Kanem-Bornu Empire, centered around the Lake Chad Basin, existed between the 9 and 19 centuries, and during its peak, the empire controlled territory stretching from southern Chad to southern Libya and included portions of modern-day Algeria, Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger, and Sudan. The Sudanese warlord Rabih AZZUBAYR used an army comprised largely of slaves to conquer the Kanem-Bornu Empire in the late 19 century. In southeastern Chad, the Bagirmi and Ouaddai (Wadai) kingdoms emerged in the 15 and 16 centuries and lasted until the arrival of the French in the 19 and 20 centuries. France began moving into the region in the late 1880s and defeated the Bagirmi kingdom in 1897, Rabih AZ-ZUBAYR in 1900, and the Ouddai kingdom in 1909. In the arid regions of northern Chad and southern Libya, an Islamic order called the Sanusiyya (Sanusi) relied heavily on the trans-Saharan slave trade and had upwards of 3 million followers by the 1880s.

Although Chile declared its independence in 1810, it did not achieve decisive victory over the Spanish until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia to win its present northern regions. In the 1880s, the Chilean central government gained control over the central and southern regions inhabited by the Mapuche. After a series of elected governments, the three-year-old Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by General Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a democratically-elected president was inaugurated in 1990. Economic reforms, maintained consistently since the 1980s, contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty rates by over half, and helped secure the country’s commitment to democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its status as a stable, democratic nation.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Southern South America, bordering the South Pacific Ocean, between Argentina and Peru', 'Geographic_coordinates': '30 00 S, 71 00 W', 'Map_references': 'South America', 'Area': {'total': '756,102 sq km', 'land': '743,812 sq km', 'water': '12,290 sq km', 'note': 'includes Easter Island (Isla de Pascua) and Isla Sala y Gomez', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '39'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly smaller than twice the size of Montana', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '7,801 km', 'border_countries_3': 'Argentina 6691 km, Bolivia 942 km, Peru 168 km'}, 'Coastline': '6,435 km', 'Maritime_claims': {'territorial_sea': '12 nm', 'contiguous_zone': '24 nm', 'exclusive_economic_zone': '200 nm', 'continental_shelf': '200/350 nm'}, 'Climate': 'temperate; desert in north; Mediterranean in central region; cool and damp in south', 'Terrain': 'low coastal mountains, fertile central valley, rugged Andes in east', 'Elevation': {'highest_point': 'Nevado Ojos del Salado 6,893 m (highest volcano in the world)', 'lowest_point': 'Pacific Ocean 0 m', 'mean_elevation': '1,871 m'}, 'Natural_resources': 'copper, timber, iron ore, nitrates, precious metals, molybdenum, hydropower', 'Land_use': {'agricultural_land': '21.1% (2018 est.)', 'arable_land': '1.7% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_crops': '0.6% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_pasture': '18.8% (2018 est.)', 'forest': '21.9% (2018 est.)', 'other': '57% (2018 est.)'}, 'Irrigated_land': '11,100 sq km (2012)', 'Major_lakes_area_sq_km': 'Fresh water lake(s)', 'Population_distribution': '90% of the population is located in the middle third of the country around the capital of Santiago; the far north (anchored by the Atacama Desert) and the extreme south are relatively underpopulated', 'Natural_hazards': 'severe earthquakes; active volcanism; tsunamis', 'volcanism': 'significant volcanic activity due to more than three-dozen active volcanoes along the Andes Mountains; Lascar (5,592 m), which last erupted in 2007, is the most active volcano in the northern Chilean Andes; Llaima (3,125 m) in central Chile, which last erupted in 2009, is another of the country’s most active; Chaiten’s 2008 eruption forced major evacuations; other notable historically active volcanoes include Cerro Hudson, Calbuco, Copahue, Guallatiri, Llullaillaco, Nevados de Chillan, Puyehue, San Pedro, and Villarrica; see note 2 under “Geography - note”'}}, {'section': 'PEOPLE AND SOCIETY', 'content': {'Population': '18,307,925 (July 2021 est.)', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '41', 'Nationality': {'noun': 'Chilean(s)', 'adjective': 'Chilean'}, 'Ethnic_groups': 'White and non-Indigenous 88.9%, Mapuche 9.1%, Aymara 0.7%, other indigenous groups 1% (includes Rapa Nui, Likan Antai, Quechua, Colla, Diaguita, Kawesqar, Yagan or Yamana), unspecified 0.3% (2012 est.)', 'Languages': 'Spanish 99.5% (official), English 10.2%, indigenous 1% (includes Mapudungun, Aymara, Quechua, Rapa Nui), other 2.3%, unspecified 0.2%; note - shares sum to more than 100% because some respondents gave more than one answer on the census (2012 est.)', 'major-language_samples': '', 'Religions': 'Roman Catholic 66.7%, Evangelical or Protestant 16.4%, Jehovah’s Witness 1%, other 3.4%, none 11.5%, unspecified 1.1% (2012 est.)', 'Demographic_profile': 'Chile is in the advanced stages of demographic transition and is becoming an aging society - with fertility below replacement level, low mortality rates, and life expectancy on par with developed countries.

The imperial era of China began in 220 B.C. under the Qin Dynasty and lasted until the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912. During this period, China alternated between periods of unity and disunity under a succession of imperial dynasties. In the 19 century, the Qing Dynasty suffered heavily from imperialism, military defeats, and foreign occupation. It collapsed following the Revolution of 1911, and China became a republic under SUN Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist) Party. However, the republic was beset by division, warlordism, and continued foreign occupation. In the late 1920s, a civil war erupted between the ruling KMT-controlled government led by CHIANG Kai-shek, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by MAO Zedong. Japan occupied much of northeastern China in the early 1930s, and then launched a full-scale invasion of the country in 1937. The resulting eight years of warfare devastated the country and cost up to 20 million Chinese lives by the time of Japan’s defeat in 1945. The Nationalist-Communist civil war continued with renewed intensity following the end of World War II and culminated with a CCP victory in 1949.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Eastern Asia, bordering the East China Sea, Korea Bay, Yellow Sea, and South China Sea, between North Korea and Vietnam', 'Geographic_coordinates': '35 00 N, 105 00 E', 'Map_references': 'Asia', 'Area': {'total': '9,596,960 sq km', 'land': '9,326,410 sq km', 'water': '270,550 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '5'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly smaller than the US', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '22,457 km', 'border_countries_14': 'Afghanistan 91 km, Bhutan 477 km, Burma 2129 km, India 2659 km, Kazakhstan 1765 km, North Korea 1352 km, Kyrgyzstan 1063 km, Laos 475 km, Mongolia 4630 km, Nepal 1389 km, Pakistan 438 km, Russia (northeast) 4133 km and Russia (northwest) 46 km, Tajikistan 477 km, Vietnam 1297 km'}, 'Coastline': '14,500 km', 'Maritime_claims': {'territorial_sea': '12 nm', 'contiguous_zone': '24 nm', 'exclusive_economic_zone': '200 nm', 'continental_shelf': '200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin'}, 'Climate': 'extremely diverse;

A decades-long conflict between government forces, paramilitaries, and antigovernment insurgent groups heavily funded by the drug trade, principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), escalated during the 1990s. More than 31,000 former United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) paramilitaries demobilized by the end of 2006, and the AUC as a formal organization ceased to operate. In the wake of the paramilitary demobilization, illegal armed groups arose, whose members include some former paramilitaries. After four years of formal peace negotiations, the Colombian Government signed a final peace accord with the FARC in November 2016, which was subsequently ratified by the Colombian Congress. The accord calls for members of the FARC to demobilize, disarm, and reincorporate into society and politics. The accord also committed the Colombian Government to create three new institutions to form a ‘comprehensive system for truth, justice, reparation, and non-repetition,’ to include a truth commission, a special unit to coordinate the search for those who disappeared during the conflict, and a ‘Special Jurisdiction for Peace’ to administer justice for conflict-related crimes. The Colombian Government has stepped up efforts to expand its presence into every one of its administrative departments. Despite decades of internal conflict and drug-related security challenges, Colombia maintains relatively strong democratic institutions characterized by peaceful, transparent elections and the protection of civil liberties.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Northern South America, bordering the Caribbean Sea, between Panama and Venezuela, and bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Ecuador and Panama', 'Geographic_coordinates': '4 00 N, 72 00 W', 'Map_references': 'South America', 'Area': {'total': '1,138,910 sq km', 'land': '1,038,700 sq km', 'water': '100,210 sq km', 'note': 'includes Isla de Malpelo, Roncador Cay, and Serrana Bank', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '27'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly less than twice the size of Texas', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '6,672 km', 'border_countries_5': 'Brazil 1790 km, Ecuador 708 km, Panama 339 km, Peru 1494 km, Venezuela 2341 km'}, 'Coastline': '3,208 km (Caribbean Sea 1,760 km, North Pacific Ocean 1,448 km)', 'Maritime_claims': {'territorial_sea': '12 nm', 'exclusive_economic_zone': '200 nm', 'continental_shelf': '200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation'}, 'Climate': 'tropical along coast and eastern plains; cooler in highlands', 'Terrain': 'flat coastal lowlands, central highlands, high Andes Mountains, eastern lowland plains (Llanos)', 'Elevation': {'highest_point': 'Pico Cristobal Colon 5,730 m', 'lowest_point': 'Pacific Ocean 0 m', 'mean_elevation': '593 m'}, 'Natural_resources': 'petroleum, natural gas, coal, iron ore, nickel, gold, copper, emeralds, hydropower', 'Land_use': {'agricultural_land': '37.5% (2018 est.)', 'arable_land': '1.4% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_crops': '1.6% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_pasture': '34.5% (2018 est.)', 'forest': '54.4% (2018 est.)', 'other': '8.1% (2018 est.)'}, 'Irrigated_land': '10,900 sq km (2012)', 'Major_watersheds_area_sq_km': 'Atlantic Ocean drainage', 'Major_aquifers': 'Amazon Basin', 'Major_rivers_by_length_in_km': 'Rio Negro river source (shared with Venezuela and Brazil [m]) - 2,250 km; Orinoco (shared with Venezuela [s]) - 2,101 km', 'Population_distribution': 'the majority of people live in the north and west where agricultural opportunities and natural resources are found; the vast grasslands of the llanos to the south and east, which make up approximately 60% of the country, are sparsely populated', 'Natural_hazards': 'highlands subject to volcanic eruptions; occasional earthquakes; periodic droughts', 'volcanism': 'Galeras (4,276 m) is one of Colombia’s most active volcanoes, having erupted in 2009 and 2010 causing major evacuations; it has been deemed a Decade Volcano by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth’s Interior, worthy of study due to its explosive history and close proximity to human populations; Nevado del Ruiz (5,321 m), 129 km (80 mi) west of Bogota, erupted in 1985 producing lahars (mudflows) that killed 23,000 people; the volcano last erupted in 1991; additionally, after 500 years of dormancy, Nevado del Huila reawakened in 2007 and has experienced frequent eruptions since then; other historically active volcanoes include Cumbal, Dona Juana, Nevado del Tolima, and Purace', 'Geography_-_note': 'only South American country with coastlines on both the North Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea'}}, {'section': 'PEOPLE AND SOCIETY', 'content': {'Population': '50,355,650 (July 2021 est.)', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '82', 'Nationality': {'noun': 'Colombian(s)', 'adjective': 'Colombian'}, 'Ethnic_groups': 'Mestizo and White 87.6%, Afro-Colombian (includes Mulatto, Raizal, and Palenquero) 6.8%, Amerindian 4.3%, unspecified 1.4% (2018 est.)', 'Languages': 'Spanish (official)', 'major-language_samples': '', 'Religions': 'Roman Catholic 79%, Protestant 14% (includes Pentecostal 6%, mainline Protestant 2%, other 6%), other 2%, unspecified 5% (2014 est.)', 'Demographic_profile': 'Colombia is in the midst of a demographic transition resulting from steady declines in its fertility, mortality, and population growth rates.

Residents of Mayotte voted to remain in France, and France now has classified it as a department of France. Since independence, Comoros has endured political instability through realized and attempted coups. In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999, military chief Col. AZALI Assoumani seized power of the entire government in a bloodless coup; he initiated the 2000 Fomboni Accords, a power-sharing agreement in which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and each island maintains its local government. AZALI won the 2002 federal presidential election as president of the Union of the Comoros from Grande Comore Island, which held the first four-year term. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed SAMBI was elected to office as president from Anjouan. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan’s de-facto secession from the Union of the Comoros, refusing to step down when Comoros’ other islands held legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU) initially attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and a naval blockade to Anjouan, but in March 2008 the AU and Comoran soldiers seized the island. The island’s inhabitants generally welcomed the move. In 2009, the Comorian population approved a constitutional referendum extending the term of the president from four years to five years. In May 2011, Ikililou DHOININE won the presidency in peaceful elections widely deemed to be free and fair.

A new constitution adopted three years later provided for a multi-party system and a seven-year presidential term, and elections arranged shortly thereafter installed SASSOU-Nguesso. Following a year of renewed fighting, President SASSOU-Nguesso and southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March 2003. SASSOU-Nguesso was reeelected in 2009 and, after passing a referendum allowing him to run for a third term, was reelected again in 2016.

To the center and east, the Kingdoms of Luba and Lunda ruled from the 16th and 17th centuries to the 19th century. in the 1870s, European exploration of the Congo Basin, sponsored by King Leopold II of Belgium, eventually allowed the ruler to acquire rights to the Congo territory and to make it his private property under the name of the Congo Free State. During the Free State, the king’s colonial military forced the local population to produce rubber. From 1885 to 1908, millions of Congolese people died as a result of disease and exploitation.

It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler, fertile central highlands. The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In 1821, Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America, but this federation disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century, only two brief periods of violence have marred the country’s democratic development. On 1 December 1948, Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces. Although it still maintains a large agricultural sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is relatively high.

Large numbers of African slaves were imported to work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement and occasional rebellions were harshly suppressed. US intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established Cuban independence from Spain in 1898 and, following three-and-a-half years of subsequent US military rule, Cuba became an independent republic in 1902 after which the island experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military and corrupt politicians. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in 1959; his authoritarian rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly five decades. He stepped down as president in February 2008 in favor of his younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba’s communist revolution, with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Miguel DIAZ-CANEL Bermudez, hand-picked by Raul CASTRO to succeed him, was approved as president by the National Assembly and took office on 19 April 2018. DIAZ-CANEL was appointed First Secretary of the Communist Party on 19 April 2021 following the resignation of Raul CASTRO.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Caribbean, island between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, 150 km south of Key West, Florida', 'Geographic_coordinates': '21 30 N, 80 00 W', 'Map_references': 'Central America and the Caribbean', 'Area': {'total': '110,860 sq km', 'land': '109,820 sq km', 'water': '1,040 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '106'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly smaller than Pennsylvania', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '28.5 km', 'border_countries_1': 'US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay 28.5 km', 'note': 'Guantanamo Naval Base is leased by the US and remains part of Cuba'}, 'Coastline': '3,735 km', 'Maritime_claims': {'territorial_sea': '12 nm', 'contiguous_zone': '24 nm', 'exclusive_economic_zone': '200 nm'}, 'Climate': 'tropical;

Tensions between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority communities came to a head in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia. Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic intercommunal violence continued, forcing most Turkish Cypriots into enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek Government-sponsored attempt to overthrow the elected president of Cyprus was met by military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot administered area declared itself the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”), but it is recognized only by Turkey. An UN-mediated agreement, the Annan Plan, failed to win approval by both communities in 2004. In February 2014, after a hiatus of nearly two years, the leaders of the two communities resumed formal discussions under UN auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island. The most recent round of negotiations to reunify the island were suspended in July 2017 after failure to achieve a breakthrough. The entire island entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the internationally recognized government, and is suspended in the “TRNC.” However, individual Turkish Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens of EU states.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Middle East, island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey;

During the interwar years, having rejected a federal system, the new country’s predominantly Czech leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Slovaks, the Sudeten Germans, and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). On the eve of World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the territory that today comprises Czechia, and Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the war, a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country’s leaders to liberalize communist rule and create “socialism with a human face,” ushering in a period of repression known as “normalization.” The peaceful “Velvet Revolution” swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a nonviolent “velvet divorce” into its two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. The country added the short-form name Czechia in 2016, while continuing to use the full form name, Czech Republic.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Central Europe, between Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and Austria', 'Geographic_coordinates': '49 45 N, 15 30 E', 'Map_references': 'Europe', 'Area': {'total': '78,867 sq km', 'land': '77,247 sq km', 'water': '1,620 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '116'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'about two-thirds the size of Pennsylvania;

Il ne subsiste que deux langues baltes, le letton et le lituanien, parlés respectivement par 2 et 3 millions de personnes. Les baltes vivent en très grande majorité dans les république de Lettonie et de Lituanie, mais on en trouve quelques centaines de milliers émigrés dans le monde occidental, principalement aux États-Unis. Le vieux prussien, qui s’est parlé en Prusse orientale jusqu’au XVIIe siècle et a disparu depuis, était également une langue balte. Les langues baltes sont indo-européennes et se situent entre les langues germaniques et les langues slaves, tout en étant plus proches de ces dernières. Certains caractères archaïques des langues baltes, et surtout du lituanien ont fait dire qu’elles étaient les plus proches parentes du sanskrit parmi les langues européennes. Écrit en caractères gothiques jusqu’au XXe siècle, les langues baltes s’écrivent avec l’alphabet latin. Les particularités phonétiques des langues baltes ont conduit à ajouter quelques signes aux lettres latines, telles qu’une barre au-dessus des voyelles longues, ou une cédille au l pour rendre un l mouillé. La phonétique des langues baltes est plus simple que celle du russe, en ce sens que l’accent tombe le plus souvent sur la première syllabe et qu’il ne modifie pas la valeur de la voyelle. Comme en russe, on ne trouve pas d’article dans les langues baltes, et les noms se déclinent selon six cas. Si de nombreux mots du vocabulaire balte évoquent clairement leur appartenance indo-européenne ou leur parenté avec des mots russe et allemand, il ne faudrait pas en déduire que les langues baltes ne sont en quelque sorte, qu’une langue intermédiaire entre le russe et l’allemand : il s’agit bien d’une famille distincte des langues indo-européennes, au vocabulaire souvent original. Le mot balte, d’où vient le nom de ces langues signifie blanc. Il est étymologiquement lié au russe boloto (marécages).

Bien qu'appartenant physiographiquement au continent nord-américain, le Groenland a été politiquement et culturellement associé à l'Europe — en particulier à la Norvège et au Danemark, les puissances coloniales, ainsi qu'à l'île voisine d'Islande — pendant plus d'un millénaire. Le Groenland est la deuxième plus grande île du monde. Plus des trois quarts de son territoire sont couverts par la seule calotte glaciaire contemporaine en dehors de l'Antarctique. Avec une population de 56 081 habitants au 1er janvier 2020, il est le pays le moins densément peuplé[Quoi ?] au monde.
Le Groenland a été habité pendant au moins les 4 500 dernières années par des peuples de l'Arctique dont les ancêtres ont migré depuis ce qui est aujourd'hui le Canada,.
Les Vikings se sont installés dans la partie sud (alors inhabitée) du Groenland, à partir du Xe siècle, y fondant des colonies médiévales qui n'auraient pas dépassé 2 000 habitants (et non 3 000 comme évoqué par Bandi en 1952) (Thomas McGovern, spécialiste américain des Vikings, parle de 6 000), puis ils ont disparu aux environs de l'an 1500 apr. J.-C.,, les colonies nordiques ont disparu à la fin du XVe siècle et les peuples inuits actuels sont arrivés au XIIIe siècle. Au début du XVIIIe siècle, la Scandinavie et le Groenland ont repris contact l'un avec l'autre, et le royaume de Danemark et de Norvège a établi sa souveraineté sur l'île.
Le Danemark-Norvège a revendiqué le Groenland pendant des siècles. Le Groenland a été colonisé il y a plus de mille ans par les Norvégiens, qui avaient déjà colonisé l'Islande pour échapper aux persécutions du roi de Norvège et de son gouvernement central. C'est depuis le Groenland et l'Islande que les Norvégiens auraient pris la mer pour découvrir l'Amérique — près de 500 ans avant Christophe Colomb — et tenté de coloniser la terre. Bien que sous l'influence continue de la Norvège et des Norvégiens, le Groenland n'était pas formellement sous la couronne norvégienne avant 1262. Le royaume de Norvège s'est étendu et devient une puissance militaire jusqu'au milieu du XIVe siècle. Mais la Norvège fut considérablement frappée par la peste noire, avec un nombre de morts supérieur à celui du Danemark, l'obligeant à accepter une union avec ce dernier dans laquelle le gouvernement central, l'université et d'autres institutions fondamentales étaient situés à Copenhague. Ainsi, les ressources des deux royaumes ont fusionné, la Norvège devenant ainsi la partie la plus faible et perdant également sa souveraineté sur le Groenland en 1814 lors de la dissolution de l'union. Le Groenland devint alors une colonie danoise, puis une partie de la Communauté du royaume du Danemark en 1953 en vertu de la Constitution du Danemark.
En 1973, le Groenland rejoint la Communauté économique européenne (CEE) avec le Danemark. Cependant, lors d'un référendum en 1982, une majorité de la population a voté en faveur d'un retrait du Groenland de la CEE, retrait qui sera par la suite étendu à l'Union européenne. En 1984, le Danemark a signé un traité modificatif avec la Communauté européenne pour préciser la situation du Groenland. Ce territoire a été retiré des accords sur le charbon et l'acier (CECA) et des accords sur l'énergie atomique (Euratom). Des dispositions particulières ont été convenues pour protéger la pêche. Le Groenland bénéficie néanmoins de la libre circulation des Européens au sens de la convention de Schengen. En 1979, le Danemark a accordé une autonomie interne au Groenland, et le 25 novembre 2008, les Groenlandais se sont prononcés par référendum consultatif sur la perspective d'une autonomie renforcée, la proposition étant approuvée par 75 % des suffrages exprimés. Le Parlement danois a ensuite voté la loi sur l'autonomie renforcée du Groenland, promulguée le 19 mai 2009 et entrée en application le 21 juin 2009. Le Danemark cède à son ancienne colonie 32 domaines de compétences, dont ceux de la police et de la justice. La politique monétaire, la défense et la politique étrangère restent toutefois sous contrôle danois. En août 2019, le président des États-Unis Donald Trump a émis l'idée d'acheter le Groenland. La Première ministre danoise, Mette Frederiksen, a refusé.

In 1990, the junta permitted an election but then rejected the results when the main opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) and its leader AUNG SAN SUU KYI won in a landslide. The junta placed AUNG SAN SUU KYI under house arrest for much of the next 20 years, until November 2010. In 2007, rising fuel prices in Burma led prodemocracy activists and Buddhist monks to launch a “Saffron Revolution” consisting of large protests against the ruling junta, which violently suppressed the movement by killing an unknown number of participants and arresting thousands. The regime prevented new elections until it had drafted a constitution designed to preserve its control; it passed the new constitution in its 2008 referendum, days after Cyclone Nargis killed at least 138,000. The junta conducted an election in 2010, but the NLD boycotted the vote, and the military’s Union Solidarity and Development Party easily won; international observers denounced the election as flawed.'}}, {'section': 'GEOGRAPHY', 'content': {'Location': 'Southeastern Asia, bordering the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal, between Bangladesh and Thailand', 'Geographic_coordinates': '22 00 N, 98 00 E', 'Map_references': 'Southeast Asia', 'Area': {'total': '676,578 sq km', 'land': '653,508 sq km', 'water': '23,070 sq km', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '42'}, 'Area_-_comparative': 'slightly smaller than Texas', 'Land_boundaries': {'total': '6,522 km', 'border_countries_5': 'Bangladesh 271 km, China 2129 km, India 1468 km, Laos 238 km, Thailand 2416 km'}, 'Coastline': '1,930 km', 'Maritime_claims': {'territorial_sea': '12 nm', 'contiguous_zone': '24 nm', 'exclusive_economic_zone': '200 nm', 'continental_shelf': '200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin'}, 'Climate': 'tropical monsoon; cloudy, rainy, hot, humid summers (southwest monsoon, June to September); less cloudy, scant rainfall, mild temperatures, lower humidity during winter (northeast monsoon, December to April)', 'Terrain': 'central lowlands ringed by steep, rugged highlands', 'Elevation': {'highest_point': 'Gamlang Razi 5,870 m', 'lowest_point': 'Andaman Sea/Bay of Bengal 0 m', 'mean_elevation': '702 m'}, 'Natural_resources': 'petroleum, timber, tin, antimony, zinc, copper, tungsten, lead, coal, marble, limestone, precious stones, natural gas, hydropower, arable land', 'Land_use': {'agricultural_land': '19.2% (2018 est.)', 'arable_land': '16.5% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_crops': '2.2% (2018 est.)', 'permanent_pasture': '0.5% (2018 est.)', 'forest': '48.2% (2018 est.)', 'other': '32.6% (2018 est.)'}, 'Irrigated_land': '22,950 sq km (2012)', 'Pacific_Ocean_drainage': 'Mekong (805,604 sq km)', 'Major_rivers_by_length_in_km': 'Mekong (shared with China [s], Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam [m]) - 4,350 km; Salween river mouth (shared with China [s] and Thailand) - 3,060 km; Irrawaddy river mouth (shared with China [s]) - 2,809 km; Chindwin - 1,158 km', 'Population_distribution': 'population concentrated along coastal areas and in general proximity to the shores of the Irrawaddy River; the extreme north is relatively underpopulated', 'Natural_hazards': 'destructive earthquakes and cyclones; flooding and landslides common during rainy season (June to September); periodic droughts', 'Geography_-_note': 'strategic location near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes; the north-south flowing Irrawaddy River is the country’s largest and most important commercial waterway'}}, {'section': 'PEOPLE AND SOCIETY', 'content': {'Population': '57,069,099 (July 2021 est.)', 'country_comparison_to_the_world': '178', 'Nationality': {'noun': 'Burmese (singular and plural)', 'adjective': 'Burmese'}, 'Ethnic_groups': 'Burman (Bamar) 68%, Shan 9%, Karen 7%, Rakhine 4%, Chinese 3%, Indian 2%, Mon 2%, other 5%', 'note': 'median age at first birth among women 25-49', 'Languages': 'Burmese (official)', 'major-language_samples': '', 'Religions': 'Buddhist 87.9%, Christian 6.2%, Muslim 4.3%, Animist 0.8%, Hindu 0.5%, other 0.2%, none 0.1% (2014 est.)', 'Demographic_profile': 'Burma’s 2014 national census – the first in more than 30 years – revealed that the country’s total population is approximately 51.5 million, significantly lower than the Burmese Government’s prior estimate of 61 million.
